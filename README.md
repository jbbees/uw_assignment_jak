**Company Thesis and Formation** 

Digital Asset Holdings, LLC was originally formed in 2014. Their idea is very was simple: you can implement a **distributed ledger** on any store of value or asset and not specifically a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin backing it. And a distributed ledger software package that can generate hundreds of smart contracts with minimal code. They published an official [white-paper](https://hub.digitalasset.com/hubfs/Documents/Digital%20Asset%20Platform%20-%20Non-technical%20White%20Paper.pdf) of their Digital Asset Modeling Language, or DAML. 

According to 2020 Forbes [expose](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjessel/2020/02/19/digital-asset-steps-up-a-gear-in-enterprise-blockchain/?sh=51ef76eb7f9a) written in 2020:
> The company, founded in 2014 by Sunil Hirani, Don Wilson, Yuval Rooz, Shaul Kfir and Eric Saraniecki out of a bitcoin trading operation created by the Chicago trading firm DRW, rose quickly to prominence through aggressive acquisitions in talent and technology. 

Sunil Hirani, one of the two core founders started the firm with funds he received on a 2008 sale of one of his many side ventures which sold for $513 million. Most of the other founders worked in the bitcoin division of DRW

The first operating year the founding team were all in interchangeable roles. A decision was made to bring in an offical CEO who had finance executive experience. Blythe Masters of JP Morgan was chosen in 2015. Before joinig Digital Asset, she was Wallstreet's go-to general to strategize, contain, and control blockchain. Her primary goal was to issue crypto-securities on a **permissioned** blockchain ledger. Instead of a **trust-less** ledger system where participants and transactions are anonymous and transactions anonymously which is what their DAML smrt, Masters wanted to change it to complete permissioned system where you need to be invited in order to use it. And Master's had particular finance products in mind to use for the blockchain: stock trading.  

Blythe Masters:
> Digital Asset Holdings deemed syndicated loans, U.S. Treasury repos, and equity shares in private companies as particularly “ripe for an overhaul.” - [New York Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2015/09/01/how-blythe-masters-bitcoin-technology-startup.html)

Participating banks and companies would issue company stock shares using the blockchain. That makes sense given the large amount of market participation with the advances in mobile banking and mobile stock buying through Robinhood. The only problem about this is, you need to have SEC approval to do any of this, which they never obtained. So they can't even issue the products they're selling, and any development of the DAML smart-contract was put on the back burner so to speak.  

In the meantime she led all the compant funding. Most of Blythe Masters tenure as CEO was leading Series-B funding rounds from her WallStreet connectiions. She deployed a high-profile executive team of finance managers to business-face and excite investment into the company esepcially from overseas like the Austrailian Stock Exchange. Blythe used her connections at JP Morgan & PNC Bank. And then she led a series of acquisitions of other notable blockchain startups Hyperledger being the biggest and noticeable acquisiton. But while financial institions were hopeful of blockchain, the enthusiasm quieted down.  

> Critics began to point to shifts in the company’s business strategy and the slow progress of deals as evidence of Digital Asset’s shaky foundation. A number of clients were reticent to move beyond the successful pilot phase into a production setting; the Depository Trust Clearing Corporation hit pause because, as  Murray Pozmanter, head of clearing agency services, explained,“basically, it became a solution in search of a problem.” - [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjessel/2020/02/19/digital-asset-steps-up-a-gear-in-enterprise-blockchain/?sh=51ef76eb7f9a)

In 2018 Blythe left the company. 

**2019 - Present, Yuval Rooz CEO**

After Blythe Master's departure in December 2018, which followed many executive departures responsible 
Yuval Rooz, one of the co-founders and engineering staff was made the new CEO. Since Digital Asset wasn't able to issue blockchain equities products and finance companue
Rooz decided to pivot their blockchain to non-finance related sectors like healthcare and retail. They currently are in works with getting funding from Samsung and Salesforce. But rollout of their smart contract package is slow to adopt just like in 

They did an overall audit of where they were at lauching the DAML lanaguage, and it wasn't complete. 

> While that may be the case, those that are close to the language have complained that it is hard to use, mirroring aspects of how financial instruments work rather than how programmers intuitively think. That creates a learning curve and commands a very different programing mindset than is employed by developers of traditional non-domain-specific languages, such as Java, making adoption more challenging. - [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjessel/2020/02/19/digital-asset-steps-up-a-gear-in-enterprise-blockchain/?sh=51ef76eb7f9a)

Yooz brought-in VNMWare to basically build DAML because they spent most of their time buying other blockchain companies. One 
So in other words: a software company is having another software company makes its software. And that brought pessimism into how the compant could grow. 

> VMWare had stepped in to the project as a new partner.  With VMWare appearing to have taken over the consensus layer of Digital Asset’s stack in the deal and Digital Asset switching the attention to DAML, critics seized on this as evidence that Digital Asset was having challenges with their technology, requiring a third party to step in.

> While DAML is free to use, the company plans to charge a support fee for enterprise support. That will allow adopters to ensure that they are eligible for upgrades, special enterprise features, and s expert assistance around how to use the language effectively.

The company will also offer – and charge for – “customer enablement services” to provide the expertise and support to help clients with deployment into production; as adopters are starting to find out for themselves, it’s one thing to experiment with the technology in the lab, quite another undertaking to move it to production.

#### Landscape

**What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**

Digital Asset is in the **distributed ledger technology** or DLT, domain of blockchain. In particular distributed ledgers that does not need the backing of a token or coin, which was revolutionary at the time.  

**What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**
The landscape of blockchain at the inception of Digital Asset was very broad, that blockchain could be used to solve any kind of problem applicable to finance and business in general. Between 2012-2017 blockchain-specialty startups have garnered investment from well-established banks, investment firms, and hedge funds worldwide excited to develop a useable technology to replace the costly reconcilation-based ledgers banks have now. But through the years finance providers had very little success in finding a way to fluidly rollover into blockchain as there's no clear, or even cheap way, of mass converting to another kind of mass-transaction platform, that doesn't disrupt daily transaction-flow cuurently. Plus you need the cooperation of every party in the space for a decentralized ledger to work. And there's various kinds of ledgers for different financial activities. Though banks and institutions have invested heavily into their own ledgers and infrastructure to simply abandon them, but these ledgers are costly to maintain as it is, so the financial sector has not divested their interest in blockchain technology, but funding has now become conservative. Post-2017 with finance investment plateauing, innovators including Digital Asset have been trying to pivot to other sectors like healthcare or retail to implement blockchain, but still no mass adoption in those industries. Customers simply do not know how to use blockchain technology, complain that the languages are too difficult to use with their systems, and do not have a solid understanding of what decentralization means. Decentralization utlimately means cost reduction and faster processing times, which increases spending with consumers. But some companies think blockchain takes away their business footprint.

One major breakthrough blockchain has been implented in is equity ledgers. With mobile banking and mobile investment tools catered to everyday people, particapation

##### Results

**What has been the business impact Digital Asset had so far?**

The business impact has been outside the United States since the free-ware version of DAML was released in 2019. The [Austrailian Stock Exchange (ASX)](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3527268/asx-prepares-to-launch-daml-training-service.html) is the flagship project looking to replace their trading system with companies registered on the index. [Chinese blockchains](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/daml-bsn-blockchain-interoperability-china-blockchain-service-network/) have found the open-source DAML language to help implenent their own blockchain network. To date, no U.S. based finance firms or exchanges are poised to use DAML. Digital Asset  

> Digital Asset’s brand remains closely associated with financial services; the company is a regular fixture at Barclay’s derivatives hackathon, where the majority of teams choose to use DAML over other smart contract languages. Digital Asset also sends their own team to the hackathon and claims to have created a simple swaps contract in just 100 lines of DAML compared to  the 800 lines of Kotlin. For the company, that’s a major proofpoint of the language for Fintech.
